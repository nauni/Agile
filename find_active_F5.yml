#      short_description: Query ACI for the node reporting F5 virtual IP address, update iRule
#      description: This playbook issues a class query of fvReportingNode, with a query filter
#                   wildcard on the virtual IP address shared between two high availablity F5's.
#                   The F5 appliances are running in an ACI streatched fabric between two
#                   data centers. The 'east' data center node ID's range from 100-199 and 
#                   the 'west' data center has nodes ranging from 200-299.
#                
#                   Based on the node ID, we identify the management IP address of the 
#                   F5 BIGâ€‘IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) currently owning the virtual IP address
#                   and update an iRule to include the identity the owning F5 on the 
#                   web content visable to the end user. This funcionality assists in troubleshooting
#                   by network operations.
